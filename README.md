# Login Application

## Problem Statement
In many web applications, user authentication is a fundamental requirement. Whether it's accessing a dashboard, submitting a form, or viewing personalized content, users need a secure and reliable way to log in and register. This project was created to demonstrate a basic login and registration system using Java, JSP, and MySQL ideal for beginners learning web development and backend integration.

## Strategies Tried

### Core Features
- **Login Page**: Allows users to enter credentials and access the system.
- **Registration Page**: Enables new users to sign up by providing basic details.
- **Success & Welcome Pages**: Displays confirmation messages and greets users upon successful login.
- **Backend Logic**: Java classes (`Login.java`, `Registration.java`) handle form data and database interaction.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL with JDBC (`mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar`) for storing and validating user credentials.
- **Servlet Configuration**: Managed via `web.xml` for routing and deployment.


## What We Aim to Achieve
- **Password Encryption**: Add hashing for secure password storage.
- **Session Management**: Implement user sessions to maintain login state.
- **Validation Feedback**: Improve form validation with error messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Make the UI mobile-friendly using CSS frameworks.
- **Role-Based Access**: Introduce admin/user roles for access control.

## Observations from the Project
- **JSP and Servlets are effective** for building simple web apps.
- **Database connectivity** using JDBC is straightforward but requires careful error handling.
- **Form handling** in Java is clean and manageable with proper structure.
- **Static pages** like `success.jsp` and `welcome.jsp` help guide user flow.

## Recommendations & Improvements
- **Use MVC Architecture**: Separate concerns for better scalability.
- **Add Logging**: Track login attempts and errors for debugging.
- **Improve UX**: Add loading indicators, tooltips, and form hints.
- **Deploy on Tomcat**: Package the app as a WAR file and deploy on a servlet container.
- **Add Unit Tests**: Validate backend logic with JUnit or similar frameworks.
